    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sarah Robinson</p>
    <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Iâ€™m a student learning web development. I enjoy solving problems and building cool things with code.I am currently attending the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, where I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and plan to graduate May of 2026. Go Spartans! The coding language that I have the most experience with is Java. I have expanded my knowledge by learning Spring, Spring Boot, Javascript, JPA/Hibernate, Git, and Maven. I am excited to collaborate and create meaningful software with others as I start my software engineer internship this fall.</p>
    <p><strong>You may find me...</strong> Baking bread, making homemade dog treats, playing Hollow Knight, Assembling Legos, gardening, relaxing with a movie, or playing with our dogs!
